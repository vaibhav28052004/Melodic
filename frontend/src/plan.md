# Comprehensive Plan for Song Playback Functionality

## Plan:

1. **Update `Topbar.tsx`**:
   - Ensure that the `handleSongClick` function correctly initializes the queue and sets the current song when a song is selected from the search results.

2. **Verify `useMusicStore.ts`**:
   - Confirm that the `searchSongs` function is correctly fetching and filtering songs based on the search query. Ensure that the search results are being updated properly.

3. **Check `PlaybackControl.tsx`**:
   - Ensure that the playback controls are functioning correctly and that the play/pause button reflects the current state of playback.

4. **Review `AudioPlayer.tsx`**:
   - Confirm that the audio source is being set correctly when a new song is selected and that playback starts from the beginning of the song.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making the necessary changes, test the functionality by searching for songs and selecting them to ensure that playback works as expected.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
